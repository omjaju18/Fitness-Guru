                    and flexibility, Gary Soffer, M.D., an integrative medicine specialist at Yale Medicine, describes
                    it as “a gentle but dynamic set of two poses that helps loosen all of the back muscles.” It does
                    this by helping mobilize the joints in the spine.

                    <li>Inhaling into cow pose, arch your back so that your belly approaches the mat, lifting your chest
                        and chin.</li>
                    <li>Exhale into cat pose, drawing your navel in while rounding your back and letting gravity drop

                <P class="paragraph"><b>Health benefit: </b>Downward facing dog is one of the most versatile beginner
                    yoga poses you can find. It not
                    only helps with back pain and core strength, but also promotes flexibility from head to toe. It
                    creates traction
                    in the lower back, which takes pressure off the spine, according to Dr. Mukai. Meanwhile, your
                    hamstrings and
                    calves also get a good stretch.

                    <br>
                    <b> How to do it:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Begin by resting your hands and knees on the floor.</li>
                    <li>Press the balls of your feet into the floor and straighten your legs, raising your hips to the
                        ceiling and
                        pressing your shoulders down and back. Be mindful to not hyperextend your knees.</li>
                    <li>Try bending one knee at a time to experience a deeper stretch through your hamstrings and
                        calves.</li>

                <P class="paragraph"><b>Health benefit:</b>Bridge pose promotes core and glute strength and, in doing so, helps prevent back pain.
                    “This pose simultaneously strengthens your core and your lower back muscles,” says Dr. Soffer. “The stronger
                    your core, the less work your back needs to do.” This pose is also beneficial because it stretches the front of
                    the hips, which can get tight after sitting for long periods of time.

                        your knees.</li>
                    <li>Engaging your core and glute muscles, raise your hips so that your body forms a straight line from your
                        knees to your shoulders.</li>

                <P class="paragraph"><b>Health benefit: </b>Also known as bound angle pose, this basic yoga pose helps with flexibility, according to
                    Dr. Soffer. By letting gravity lower your knees, it opens up your hips. In fact, a study performed on people
                    with diabetes showed that, in combination with other yoga asanas, it improved subjects’ total cholesterol, blood
                    glucose and overall sense of well-being.
