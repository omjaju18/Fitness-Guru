                <h2 class="heading">Ustrasana (Camel Pose)</h2>
                <P class="paragraph">Among the best asanas for strengthening, energizing and stabilizing the body,
                    Utrasana is a
                    great beginner’s
                    pose. While there are many physical health benefits such as toughening back, thigh and buttock
                    muscles and
                    countering slouchiness, one of its major advantages is it will build confidence and empowerment in
                    your
                    adolescent.

                    <b> How To Do It:</b> Begin with kneeling perpendicular to the floor and toes wide apart. Next, take
                    a deep
                    breath in and stretch your hands back with the fingers touching the heel. Hold this position for
                    5-10
                    breaths
                    and then slowly exhale.

                    <b>Tip:</b>To gradually increase the stamina of your young one, initially make him/her hold the
                    position for
                    3-5
                    breaths, then slowly increase the span.

                    your
                    child’s
                    immunity.
